# Predicting Aqueous Solubility of Organic Molecules Using Molecular Descriptor Model

## ML model: Random Forest Regressor

## ML features: physico-chemical descriptors obtained with PaDEL software
according to article **"Predicting Aqueous Solubility of Organic Molecules Using Deep Learning Models withVaried Molecular Representations"** by Panapitiya et al, 2021 *(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.12638v1.pdf)*, Molecular Descriptor Model overperforms fully connected neural networks (FCNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and SchNet.

## Training Dataset: ESOL Delaney, Water solubility data (**LogS**, log solubility in mols per litre) for common organic small molecules.

**"Input/solubility_delaney_processed.csv"**   training dataset is obtained from https://moleculenet.org/datasets-1 , 

**"Input/solubility_delaney.csv"**  original data **Delaney "ESOL:  Estimating Aqueous Solubility Directly from Molecular Structure"** *J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci.* 2004, **44**, 3, 1000–1005)

**"Input/test.smi"** TEST dataset: 105 organic molecules from ChEMBL (SMILES and ChEMBL names) with unknown water solubility, is used to predict solubility from  structure
